<p>&nbsp;</p>

1. Reproducible_Research_Course_Project_1.Rmd: R Markdown file that contains documentation and R code

2. Reproducible_Research_Course_Project_1.html: This is the html document generated using 'knit' option on above R Markdown file 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b>Details of R Markdown file:</b>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

This file includes all documentation and R code to answer the questions based on 'activity.csv' dataset

<p>&nbsp;</p>

1. First step is to load the dataset from the .csv file
2. Next step is to calculate total number of steps per day
3. Create a histogram of steps taken each day
4. Calculate mean number of steps taken each day
5. Calculate median steps taken each day
6. Calculate the average number of steps taken by an interval
7. Find and display the interval that contains maximum number of steps
8. Next is to get the number of rows with missing steps values
9. Next step is to impute the missing values by using 'mean' number of steps
10. Create histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
11. Find the mean of the new dataset after imputing missing values
12. Find the median of the new dataset after imputing missing values
13. Add new variable called 'day' to identify whether the given date is on weekend (Satruday and Sunday) or weekday (otherwise)
14. Draw the panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays vs weekends
